# SUNDIAL
This is an [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) extension.

To install it, download `sundial.py` and `sundial.inx`. Copy the files into the directory listed at `Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions`. After a restart of Inkscape, the new extension will be available.

To generate your own sundial, please
* go to https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php
* select your location
* _execute_ the calculation
* scroll down to "Annual sun path"
* "download CSV"

Finally provide the CSV to the extention:

<img src="inkscape_menu.png" alt="Select the extension" title="Select the extension" width="20%" />

<img src="inkscape_example.png" alt="Use the extension" title="Use the extension" width="20%" />

Possibly the times and month names are not placed perfectly, please do this manually before printing.
